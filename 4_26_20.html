		<h2>Work done today</h2>
		<h4>git.add</h4>
		<p>Split add up into blob and index functions. Intended to help testing values at boundaries.</p>
        <h5>For later: </h5> 		
        <p>Write tests for blob and index functions. Modify add function to accept directories as an argument. </p>
        <h4>Huffman coding </h4>
        <p>Wrote functions to count characters in a string and make a "forest" (slice) of 1 node trees holding the character counts
            Had trouble modifying the slice. Trees would be created correctly but apparently never "put in" the slice.
            Must have something to do with pointers.
