        <h4>Huffman coding </h4>
        <p>got creation of the "forest" to work, along with the testing for it. Can't remember what exactly I was doing wrong,
            but I think I fixed it by simplifying the loop structure. Also started implementing the greedy Huffman algorithm to create
            the single tree. Still need to write the tests. I figured out a way to encode the sequence of 0's and 1's for each character
            through arithmetic (double the number to add a 0, double the number and add 1 to add a 1), but I think there's probably a
            better way. Not sure the best way to read from it either.
