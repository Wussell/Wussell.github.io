		<p>Sockets (Protocol?)</p>
		<p>Establishes connection between server and client and allocates a socket where the data is sent and received from. Connection is established using a set of defined functions (bind, accept, listen, etc.)</p>

		<p>When sending and receiving data over a network computers use protocols (ie IP -> TCP -> HTTP) to interpret the data according to a widely understood standard. Data is sent in the form of discrete chunks of bytes called packets. </p>
		<p>Once a connection/socket is established, Go treats the data to be sent and received as a writer/reader.</p>
