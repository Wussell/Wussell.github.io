        <h5>To do:</h5>
        <p>Finish makeTree function. Finish makeTree function test. Write function to map each char to its path stored as a sequence of bits. Write compression function that reads each character from the file to be compressed and writes its corresponding bit sequence to a file, along with the header containing the compression tree and the pseudo-EOF character. Write decompression function that reads a compressed file and gives back an uncompressed file identical to the original. Write tests for all functions.</p>
        <h5>exploration: </h5>
        <p>Write a function that creates an ordered binary tree given some numbers.</p>
