        <h4>Huffman coding </h4>
        <p> 
            Finished traversal of an ordered tree without recursion. Had trouble due to confusion about how declaration worked with different scopes. Could have fixed it by looking more carefully. Might need to broaden my definition of being "stuck" and ask for help more frequently in order to progress more quickly / efficiently. Still can't quite think through the bit encoding part of the Huffman problem. Will probably ask for guidance tomorrow.
        </p>
        <h5>To do:</h5>
        <p>Finish makeTree function. Finish makeTree function test. Write function to map each char to its path stored as a sequence of bits. Write compression function that reads each character from the file to be compressed and writes its corresponding bit sequence to a file, along with the header containing the compression tree and the pseudo-EOF character. Write decompression function that reads a compressed file and gives back an uncompressed file identical to the original. Write tests for all functions.</p>
        <h5>exploration: </h5>
        <p>Write a function that creates an ordered binary tree given some numbers.</p>
