        <h4>Atom feed</h4>
        <p> 
            Got a simple update function mostly working. Given a file name, it updates the Atom feed with a link to the website location and other necessary information. Had a problem with inputing the file name through the command line though. The resulting string seemed to have some unrecognized characters after the file name. Trimming the white space didn't help. Will ask about it tomorrow. Or I'll just try using a Scanner and see if that works better. 
        </p>
        <h5>To do:</h5>
        <p>Get command line input working. Automate git commit and push. Implement different functionality for updating an existing entry and for entirely new entries. Implement delete entry function. Add textual content of given file to entries.</p>
