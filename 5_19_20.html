Got it working with the new approach. Pretty simple overall, but I was still slow working out the minor bugs. But it's been the most productive day I had in a while. And this may be the first program I've written that makes my life slightly more convenient. Yay! Also, I don't think NetNewsWire updates unless an entry with a new id is added. I kept trying to add whitespace to the content on one post but nothing changed until I added a new post. Good to know.

Maybe reset the feed and build it back from the beginning so every post in the feed is formatted the same way. Change the keywords so that they're not normal words. Maybe add extra formatting to make each entry prettier? Automate git commit and push. Implement different functionality for updating an existing entry and for entirely new entries. Implement delete entry function.
