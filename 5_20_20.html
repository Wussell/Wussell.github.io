Finally got the bit sequence table working, with a lot of help. I don't think I would have been able to come up with the function I ended up using by myself. It would probably help to go through it again a few times to solidify the details. Now I'm working on the actual compressing of the file. It's fairly straightforward, but I do need to get a lot more comfortable with how Go stores and displays values, especially numbers in various bases. Hopefully I can finish the file compression tomorrow, and the decompression soon after.
