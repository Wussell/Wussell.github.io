Huffman coding:

Finished the majority of the compression function today, which was pretty satisfying. Because the problem was easily comprehensible and the solution required no hidden knowledge, it was the kind of thing where there was no barrier between thinking about the solution and implementing the correct solution. Based on my limited observations so far, I think that's a common feature of enjoyable problems, at least for me. Things started moving along nicely once I changed my approach for compression from writing entire bit sequences at a time to the compressed data structure, to writing the sequences bit by bit. It was a small and obvious change, but encouraging because I've faced problems recently where I didn't recognize telltale signs to change my method. Also, it reminds me of the example in A Philosophy of Software Design about the word processor being much simpler and better to implement if the document was modified on a character by character basis instead of line by line. Maybe a pattern to keep in mind: it's simpler to work with smaller units of information.
