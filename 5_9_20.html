        <h4>Huffman coding </h4>
        <p> Mostly just worked on implementing a stack structure using a linked list. I spent a good amount of time trying to push and pop from the end of the list, instead of the beginning, because in my previous work with linked lists I wrote functions that needed to iterate through the end of the list, so that's how I was accustomed to modifying them. This led to suspiciously complex functions. Once I learned that pushing and popping were supposed to be constant-time operations and it was therefore necessary to add to the beginning of the list, it was much simpler to implement. Noticed some tendencies in myself: I don't yet have a good nose for when things are suspiciously complex or hard to implement, so when I am having difficulty with something, I tend to just try to break on through instead of re-examining the problem and considering switching tracks. Besides today, it also happened recently while trying to get the lowest two values from a slice. I didn't even consider using the built-in sort function. My takeaway is that I should have checkpoints during the implementation process where I take time to thoroughly evaluate my approach and consider alternatives. Somthing to keep in mind.

        <h5>To do:</h5>
        <p>Finish makeTree function. Finish makeTree function test. Write function to map each char to its path stored as a sequence of bits. Write compression function that reads each character from the file to be compressed and writes its corresponding bit sequence to a file, along with the header containing the compression tree and the pseudo-EOF character. Write decompression function that reads a compressed file and gives back an uncompressed file identical to the original. Write tests for all functions.</p>
        <h5>exploration: </h5>
        <p>Write a function that creates an ordered binary tree given some numbers.</p>
