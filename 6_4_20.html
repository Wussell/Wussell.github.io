Huffman coding:

Finished decompression a few days ago, but it decompressed into gibberish, so I've been working on testing. All the random tests I threw at the tree functions (creation, compression, decompression) seemed to pass just fine, so I thought the problem had to be with the function that parsed the compressed data. However, a more granular inspection revealed the output was different every time, and an even closer inspection revealed the tree was different every time, specifically which node each character was assigned to. I think the only source of that non-determinism is when I use a map to assign the character to a node, but I don't think that's what's causing the incorrect output. I might still try to find a way around that non-determinism just so debugging is easier, but I'm not sure.
