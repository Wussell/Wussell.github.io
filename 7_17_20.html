		<h4>
Myers Diff

</h4> 
 <p> 
 
Started implementing the diff algorithm. Made a function that breaks a string into lines and wrote a test for the unbroken string and delineated string cases. Also started implementing the "shortest edit" function to find the fewest number of moves necessary to complete an edit. Ran into a slice indexing bug due to the difference in the way Ruby handles indexing, specifically negative numbers. I'll have to rethink the function pretty substantially, unless I'm missing something easy. I also started reading through the article more carefully to start getting a better feel for what the algorithm does.
