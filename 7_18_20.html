Fixed the indexing bug in the shortestEdit function by remapping negative k values relative to the end of the slice to mimic Ruby. I had thought of remapping before, but I was trying to come up with a more clever solution than calling a mapping function before every slice reference. Now that that's fixed, the function still isn't doing what I thought it should, but then again I'm not sure that I understand what it's supposed to do. Something fundamental I just learned about Go functions (and I'm guessing many other languages): every control flow path needs to have a return statement, which is a requirement I usually fulfill by only using return at the end of the function.
