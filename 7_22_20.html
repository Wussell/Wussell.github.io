Got the shortest edit function to work. As I suspected, the problem was my understanding of the function rather than my implementation. While the function is supposed to return the number of edits needed to get from string a to string b, I was expecting an output stating the number of differences in the input strings. For example, to get from "as" to "is" requires two edits (an insertion and deletion) even though the strings only differ in one place. For many of the test cases I created, the "want" value differed from the correct value by half. The next step in the diff algorithm is the implementation of the backtracking function, but Cooglan's code contains a few Ruby quirks that I need to spend some more time on to figure out.
