Fixed a bug where every element of the trace slice was updating to match the latest value of the v slice. I had forgotten the implications of the fact that a slice is a pointer to an underlying array, so if you change an element of a slice, that element is changed everywhere that slice's array is referenced. I've essentially finished the basic version of the diff code. The next thing to do if I want to make this more usable (besides small convenient improvements) is implement the linear space version of the algorithm that Git actually uses.
