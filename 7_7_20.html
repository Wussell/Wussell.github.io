Started developing the permission system. Have a couple bugs to work out.

 <h4>
to-do

</h4> 
 <p> 
 
Fix permission bugs. Work on test suite. Add function to remove/change permissions. Should photos be exclusive to one album? Should all photos go in a user's main album and then be duplicated in other albums? Should every album be a separate table?
