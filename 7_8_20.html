photo app

Fixed the bug with the permission check. When I was trying to scan the rows into a slice, I wasn't using a pointer to the slice. Wrote a quick test for the permission check and got it to pass. The photos function is now working as intended.

 <h4>
to-do

</h4> 
 <p> 
 
Expand test suite. Add function to remove/change permissions. Should photos be exclusive to one album? Should all photos go in a user's main album and then be duplicated in other albums? Should every album be a separate table?
